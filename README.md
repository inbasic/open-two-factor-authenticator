Open Two-Factor Authenticator aims to provide an open-source two-factor authentication to browsers and Android devices with synced storage.

By using this extension, you can have your encrypted keys stored in the browser's synced storage. This allows you to sync them across multiple devices. This extension uses the public key/private key method to encrypt stored data (SHA-256).
